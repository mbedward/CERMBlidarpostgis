Description: This package extends the CERMBlidar package with functions to store
  and retrieve rasters of vegetation structure and associated data in/from a 
  PostGIS database. Written for the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of
  Bushfires, University of Wollongong (UOW), Australia. Most functions are 
  wrappers around those in the lidR package. The package may be freely used by 
  anyone, but please note that: (1) Some functions are particular to data 
  conventions used by New South Wales State Government and UOW and might not be
  suitable for general use; (2) The package is at an early stage of development 
  and features are likely to change without notice between successive 0.x 
  versions.
