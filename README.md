# CERMBlidarpostgis

This is an R package developed for use by the Centre for Environmental Risk 
Management of Bushfires, University of Wollongong (UOW), Australia. It
extends the CERMBlidar package (also developed for UOW) with functions to 
store and retrieve vegetation structural data, derived from airborne LIDAR 
imagery, to a PostgreSQL / PostGIS database. 

The package may be freely used by anyone, but please note that: (1) Many 
functions are particular to data conventions used by UOW and New South Wales 
State Government and might not be suitable for general use; (2) The package 
is at an early stage of development and features are likely to change without
notice between successive 0.x
