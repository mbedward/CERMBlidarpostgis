# CERMBlidarpostgis

**Note: This package is no longer being developed 
Please see the [CERMBldb package](https://github.com/mbedward/CERMBldb) instead.**

This was an R package developed for use by the Centre for Environmental Risk 
Management of Bushfires, University of Wollongong (UOW), Australia. It
extends the [CERMBlidar package](https://github.com/mbedward/CERMBlidar) 
(also developed for UOW) with functions to store and retrieve vegetation 
structural data, derived from airborne LIDAR imagery, to a 
PostgreSQL / PostGIS database.
